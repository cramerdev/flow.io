# flow.io

[Flowdock](https://flowdock.com/) to [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) proxy.

This is just a very simple proof of concept right now, so don't expect much.

## Install

`npm install` will install the needed dependencies. Node.js and NPM are required.

## Usage

Run `node server.js` to start the socket server. On the client, emit an `auth` message like the one in the included example.html.
